DFESW10 Final Project - Ruby Embley

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

This is my final project as part of the 9-week Software Development Skills bootcamp run by QA and the Department of Education. The project brings together all the skills we covered as part of the training, including:

Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)
Programming Fundamentals (Java)
API Development (Spring Boot)
Automated Testing (JUnit, Mockito)

This was an individual project and I chose to create a Spring Boot API based on the idea of a library.

HOW I EXPECTED THE CHALLENGE TO GO:

I felt well prepared for the challenge in terms of the programming fundamentals and implementing the CRUD functionality. The pace of the course meant that we had a lot to get through in a short space of time, but I was prepared to do extra reading and go back through my notes to make sure I understood everything I was doing. I was expecting to have to refresh my knowledge of databases, Project Management and Testing in order to complete the challenge.

WHAT WENT WELL:

I found using Jira to plan and organise my project very straightforward and intuitive, it helped me to develop clear ideas about what I wanted to do and prioritise and keep track of tasks.

I found designing the structure of the project very straightforward, I think my code is well organised in clearly labelled packages.

I felt confident writing the code for the basic functionality in src/main/java. The 'search' method was not something I'd done before, it was a little more challenging but I enjoyed getting it working and having to research solutions online.

It look me a little while of trying to get the databases + postman connected, but I feel confident with that now.

WHAT DIDN'T GO AS PLANNED: 

It took me a while to get used to using feature branches on Git Hub, I failed to merge my existing branches back into main and created a few merge conflicts which I then had to take time to resolve. I've learned from this now, by the end of the week it was working well for me and I felt confident.

I'd also like to have split my User Stories on Jira up in a more intuitive way. I don't feel they reflect the way I actually worked, which added to some of my mix-ups on the project management side. But again I've learned from this
 
Unfortunately I didn't manage to produce an integration test for my 'searchLibrary' method. The method was passing its unit tests and works as it was designed to, but it is failing the integration test. I wasn't able to find a solution for this in time for the deadline, so I will look at it again in future revisions of the project.


POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS FOR FUTURE REVISIONS OF THE PROJECT:

I'd like to develop an 'update' method where you don't have to pass in the entire book, just the attribute you want to update.

I'd like to make the Library database relational by adding another table that keeps track of stock levels e.g number of copies per title.

I will add exception handling into the project, to handle typos in requests etc.
